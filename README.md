# ShowdownShare



This project is a filesharing platform for poker hand-histories. It is a Java Spring Boot application with a react frontend. All files are uploaded to AWS S3. 

Note: The frontend is vibecoded, since the intention of this project was to get better with spring boot, not building better UIs.
